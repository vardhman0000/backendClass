Why we need middleware??

In a client server architecture middlewares lies in the middle of client and server

Client --> Middleware --> Server

-> Instead of writing user authentication logic at each endpoint, this logic can be written in middleware that will execute for sure before going to any endpoint

-> next() ---> We can execute some code before routing
